### What I learned

- Handling Background Images Responsively: I learned how to <code>background-image</code> with <code>image-set()</code> for responsive images to ensure the best resolution is loaded depending on the device's screen density. To ensure browser compatability, I added <code> background-image: url(...)</code> as a fallback.
- Making Non-Interactive Elements Focusable: You can apply the :focus psuedo-class to non-interactive elements (like div containers) by adding the tabindex attribute.
- Defining Width for Flex-Wrap: I learned that when using <code>flex-wrap</code> to wrap items in a Flexbox layout, I needed to define a specific width for the container or items. Without this, the items would continuously wrap in an unorganized way, potentially causing layout issues.

### Useful resources

- **Flexbox Cheatsheet**: [A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A comprehensive guide and cheatsheet for understanding and using Flexbox in CSS. It covers all the key properties and examples for creating flexible layouts.
  
- **Image-Set for Responsive Images**: [Image-Set for Responsive Images](https://uploadcare.com/blog/image-set-for-responsive-images/) - An in-depth blog post explaining how to use the `image-set()` function for responsive images in CSS. It provides best practices for serving the right image resolution based on device pixel density.
